push and popping are:
O(1) time
o(1) space

however the visualizing is
o(n) for data that has been entered
o(1) space

tank pop without vizualising is
o(1) time
o(1) space

tank push without visualizing is
o(1) time on average but up to o(n) time (where n is data that has been entered thus far) because of the copying realloc does
o(1) space (only one more item is created each turn)
